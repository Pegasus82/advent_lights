# advent_lights

Our village has started an Advent Calendar project where 25 houses have signed up to display one of the advent calendar day numbers on the front of our houses.

Our house is number 3.

My implementation will be to have an LED matrix display the number 3 in one of our front windows.

I am following the project template here https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-led-matrix

I don't yet know how crazy this will get. Ideally I would like several animated effects drawing the number 3, but time will be the limiting factor (and my skill of course).

I would also like to have the option of changing the number from 3 to any other of the advent numbers, but I am not sure how that will be done.
